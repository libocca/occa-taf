## Follow-up

N/A

## Agenda

1. Discuss callback implementation details

## Notes

- tom: entry and exit roles give you more flexibility
- ex memory:copyTo
- simple but 3x the function calls

    void memory::copyTo(args) const {
      occa_copyTo_callback_entry(dst, byte, offset)
      // impl
      occa_copyTo_callback_exit()
    }

- maybe fn pointer list
  - but lose type safety on the args
  - prefer to fail at compile time rather than a segfault at runtime

- example OCCA code

    struct callback_events {
      // list of callback fn pointers here
    }

    void memory::copyTo(args) const {
      occa_callback_entry("copyTo_entry", arg1, arg2, ...)
      // impl
      occa_callback_exit()
    }

- is it possible to have a fixed signature for the callback?
  - copies, sure: need bytes, and offsets
  - but what if you want to trace kernel builds?  maybe it's useful to to know
    the filename or kernel name etc
  - seems like it might not be too easy to have a fixed signature

- use std::function and type aliases for the different callback sigs?
- could we do this using inheritance?
  - different objects for traced and nontraced versions of copyto?

- tom: expect occa-layer tracing to be blocking (synchronous)
- tim: the callback implementation (callback_events.copyTo_entry) can take a timestamp
- the other design point is to have occa pass a timestamp when it invokes the
  callback
- *because* we have entry/exit roles, there's really no NEED to pass a timestamp
- occa will have a build-time flag to enable/disable tracing
- fleshing out the copyTo example

    // OCCA
    struct callback_events {
      std::function f1;
      std::function f2;
      std::function f3;
      ...

    } callback_events_t
    std::map<std::string, (void ptr)> callback_table;

    // somewhere in intialisation
    occa_register_callbacks();

    // somewhere in hpp
    occa_register_callback(void pt, string) {
       callback_table[string] = void ptr;
    }

    occa_callback_entry(string, void ptr) {
      // this is a type-safety problem
      (cast to right fn sig)callback_table[string]
    }

    // Third-party
    include occa_tools.h
    void my_callback_for_copyTo_entry() { // impl }
    void occa_register_callbacks() {
      occa_register_callback(my_callback_for_copyTo_entry, "copyTo_entry");
    }

- do we want to register more than one callback for an event?
  - for example, the first one can be a validation (i.e., don't copyTo zero
      bytes)
  - the second one can be for timing
  - or perhaps multiple tracing tools?  multiple clients can do this at the
    same time
  - just a thought: no need to do it right now
- instead of string, could have a template enum and occa_register_callback is
  a template

    occa_register_callback<>()

## Action Items

- [ ] Kris mock up a templated version of occa_register_callback
