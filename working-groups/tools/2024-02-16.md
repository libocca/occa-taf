## Follow-up

N/A

## Agenda

1. Discuss Kris's mock up a templated version of occa_register_callback
2. Discuss Thomas's POC

## Notes

- tom kindly put together a more complete C proof of concept for the callback
  infrastructure
- kris put together c++ poc with stronger type safety
- create enum class types as helpers (mode)
- for each api we want to trace, have struct that contains a type alias for the
  args for that callback fn
- c++ trick: template specialisation for each set of callback methods
- add definititions for callbacks. push them onto a vector
- a lot of the infrastructure matches the C proof-of-concept
- a matter of taste/preference at this point
- thapi will Just Do It for kernels in cuda/hip/whatever
- q: does occa want to provide asynch kernel run/end info to callback
  implementers?
  - easy to extend to this later
- callback implementers do not know _when_ their callbacks will be invoked

## Action Items

- [ ] Create a branch in OCCA for tooling code
- [ ] Kris to dump POC code in the branch
- [ ] Provide two entry/exit callback hooks for THAPI
- [ ] Make THAPI call these two callback hooks

## Next Meeting

- TBD
