## Follow-up

N/A

## Agenda

1. Discuss THAPI interfacing to OCCA

## Notes

- THAPI
  - Gets device kernel timings from CUDA/whatever vendor interfaces
  - THAPI intercepts the kernel launch API and inserts events in the same stream
  - How does THAPI decide to sync and compute timing?
    - Since THAPI intercepts all cuda apis (including sync APIs), THAPI computes
      timings at this point
  - How does THAPI account for its own overhead?
    - Types of overhead
      - trace generation (host side) is ~2%
      - device-side, less well understood but likely a few percent
  - Use-case: THAPI was able to see OMP runtime overhead vs L0 runtime overhead
  - THAPI is operationally able to eke out OCCA overhead
  - Perfetto to visualise (protobuf output)
  - There are examples for providing callbacks to THAPI
  - Hash out callback interface in OCCA
  - Kris: providing the callback interface is likely required for whatever tool
    we use (including THAPI)
    - And probably the most extensible
  - Kris: we can easily discuss design for OCCA
  - Tim: all we have to do is provide entry/exit points for the stuff we care
    about
  - Tom: entry/exit per entity is preferred over global entry/exit
  - Tom: do we dump everything?  nothing?
  - Kris: nekrs guinea pig
  - Tim/Noel: libp guinea pig
  - Noel: we can do anything.  a/b test a protoype to measure overhead
  - Noel: compare output with vendor tools
  - Kris: write documenation along the way or tech report
  - Tom: this is likely a good opportunity for THAPI to improve too
