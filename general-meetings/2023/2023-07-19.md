# 2023-07-19

## Agenda

1. Open issues and pull-requests
2. Testing and development for different platforms
3. Thread Safety
4. Next Release

## Notes

### Open Issues and Pull Requests

- [Memory copies](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/686)
  - This would be a breaking change for downstream applications
  - Add a new API for copying by count instead of bytes
    - Clearly document/differenciate behaviour between this and existing API
- [CMake build variables](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/692)

### Testing and Development for Different Platforms

- It is difficult for any one person to test all OCCA backends (e.g., for different vendor GPUs)
- Having at least one point of contact for each of the backends would make it easier for OCCA developers get information about how to setup and test on their local systems

### Thread Safety

- Need to summarize state of thread-safety for different backend programming models
- Ask for volunteers to create summary for different backend programming models
  - Serial (and flavours used by other backends, like launched backends)
  - CUDA and HIP: Noel
  - SYCL and OpenCL: Kris and Umesh
  - Metal:
  - OpenMP:
- Kris will create a Google doc or similar to help collate survey results 
- In general, API calls are generally thread safe (e.g., in CUDA/HIP); however, use of return values requires care
- Should also reference Cpp Core Guidelines
- Need to outline goals for OCCA thread-safety
  - E.g., how much of API should be covered 
- Examples of similar or gold-standard (open-source, C++) projects which are thread-safe?  

### Next Release

- Will create a staging branch from development ahead of the next version release in mid-August
