## Agenda

1. Next release
2. Thread-safety of OCCA backend programming models

## Notes

### Next Release

- A [staging branch](https://github.com/libocca/occa/tree/prerelease/v1.6) is available ahead of the next release
- Will plan to merge/release v1.6 early next week

### Thread-safety of OCCA backend programming models

- The (host) thread-safety of the programming models used to implement existing OCCA backends were reviewed and summarized
- In general, most of aspects of the backend programming models (e.g., devices, streams) are thread-safe
- Two notable exceptions are:
  - Memory accesses&mdash;e.g., via kernel launches
  - Kernels (handles, execution) in OpenCL
    - This can be mitigated if each host-thread has its own copy of the kernel 
- To facilitate occa development, a common set of examples demonstrating correct host-side concurrency should be implemented for each of the backend programming models.
  - These examples will be taken from use-case provided by downstream occa applications, as well as vendor training resources and other state-of-the-art applications
