## Agenda

1. CPU Backends

## Notes

### CPU Backends

- Currently OpenMP is the only CPU backend that supports parallel kernels
- There is interest from different groups in running on new generation CPUs (e.g., Arm, AMD, etc.)
  - Support for OCCA on Arm-based processors (e.g., what is the natural choice of backend programming model in this case?)
- The OpenMP backend should be revisited and updated to use relevant new OpenMP features

## Next Meeting

Tentatively; however, could be cancelled if many are taking vacation.
