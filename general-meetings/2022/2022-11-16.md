## Follow-up

- [ ] Examine test coverage checking that recompilation does/doesn't happen when expected
- [x] Review and merge [PR 543](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/543)

## Agenda

1. Preprocessor
2. SIMD programming with OKL

## Notes

### Preprocessor

- OKL still does not support enums
- This is a priority issue for several groups using OCCA, e.g.
  - Shell
  - libCEED

### SIMD Programming 

- Performance portability is difficult to solve here
  - E.g., how should shuffle functions be implemented for the Serial backend
- To begin, features will ony be made available for a subset of backends
  - Similar to OpenCL, we should provide a way of checking at runtime if certain features/extensions are supported
  - Explore providing a fallback mechanism, similar to OpenMP variants   
- The SIMD width (warp-size) varies across hardware and backends:
  - Provide a way to query SIMD width through the host API
  - Provide a defined constant through OKL
- A performance best-practices guide for OKL should emphasize starting with the simplest, most portable approach before using more advanced features&mdash;like SIMD functionality  

- For comparison purposes, it would be useful to collect a set of examples where warp-level programming aids performance, e.g.
  - Block-wide sort
  - Block-wide reduction
  - Block LU decomposition

## Action Items

- [ ] Examine test coverage checking that recompilation does/doesn't happen when expected
- [ ] Open a GitHub issue for runtime querying SIMD width, defined constant in OKL
- [ ] Add C++ attribute for specifying sub-group size to code generation for the SYCL backend
