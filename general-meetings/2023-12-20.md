## Notes

### v2.0 Release

- Target date for release is 2024/01/17
- Minimum CMake version required is now 3.21
- Breaking changes to `occa::memory` to address inconsistency in API, follow C++ stdlib. 
  - `size()` now returns the number of entries for typed allocations (same as `length()`)
  - `byte_size()` returns the allocation size in bytes
  - `copyTo` and `copyFrom` size and offset parameters represent number of entries for typed allocations
- `occa::memoryPool` now moved into the top-level namespace from `occa::experimental` 
- Feedback on any bugs, performance issues, etc., is always appreciated
