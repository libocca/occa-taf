# 2024-02-21

## Agenda

1. Open action Items
2. Topics for 2024

## Notes

### Open Action Items

- Release v2.0 (Kris)
- Documentation
- Concurrency examples
- Examples of low/mixed-precision usage in CUDA, HIP, SYCL, etc.
- Document existing (host and kernel) macros
- GitHub discussion thread for feedback on feature test macros
- Create/find examples of atomic usage in CUDA, HIP, SYCL, etc.
- Create a mailing list

### Topics for 2024

- Walkthrough of new OKL transpiler
- Walkthrough of new OCCA Tools API
- Mini-apps (more involved than existing examples, but less than full applications)
  - Demonstrate some common parallel/solver patterns
  - Tim existing examples from courses, workshops
  - Q: Where should these examples live?
- Custom data types (for use in OKL kernels)
  - Currently need to explicitly manage all device memory in custom data types
  - Ideally users could register non-trivial data types and OCCA runtime would manage  
- Integrating new features of backend programming models
  - Device-side library for warp/block level collectives
  - Matrix/tensor core instructions
  - Q: Should we form a WG for some of these topics? 
- User survey (e.g., which backends are used?)
  - How many users of downstream applications?
    - How many write OKL kernels? 
  - How many developers of OCCA applications?
  - How many involved in OCCA development? 
- Papers?
