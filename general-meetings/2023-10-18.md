## Follow-up
*Action items from last meeting*

- [ ] Create branch for concurrency examples. 

## Agenda

1. Tools Working Group
2. Half Precision
3. Feature Test Macros

## Notes

### Tools Working Group

- A working group will be created to tackle defining and implementing an OCCA Tools API
- Check the [Tools WG page](https://github.com/libocca/occa-taf/blob/main/working-groups/tools/README.md) on GitHub for more details  

### Half Precision

- Most OCCA modes targeting GPUS support FP16
  - BF16 also has wide support
- C++23 has support for fixed-width FP types

### Feature Test Macros

- C++ standard defines [preprocessor macros](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test) to test if implementation supports certain functionality
- What OCCA macro definitions exist?
  - For the runtime API?
  - For OKL? 
- What are some use cases?
- Priorities for new macros?
