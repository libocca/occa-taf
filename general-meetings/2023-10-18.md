## Agenda

1. Tools Working Group
2. Half Precision
3. Feature Test Macros

## Notes

### Tools Working Group

- A working group will be created to tackle defining and implementing an OCCA Tools API
  - Lead by Damon McDougall
  - Plan to meet bi-weekly
- Check the [Tools WG page](https://github.com/libocca/occa-taf/blob/main/working-groups/tools/README.md) on GitHub for more details  

### Half Precision

- Most OCCA modes targeting GPUS support FP16
  - BF16 also has wide support
- C++23 has support for [fixed-width FP types](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/floating-point)
- OpenMP?
  - Clang? `__FP16` 
- Metal?
- Using the data-types on the host can be problematic
  - Mileage can vary by compiler
  - Arithmetic operators aren't necessarily defined
  - Example&mdash;`memcpy` from host-to-device vs initializing memory on GPU 
- Example use cases in backend specific code would be helpful in avoid pitfalls

### Feature Test Macros

- C++ standard defines [preprocessor macros](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test) to test if implementation supports certain functionality
- What are some use cases?
  - libP (and friends) define macros for backend specific code in OKL (e.g., `OCCA_CUDA`, `OCCA_HIP`)
  - Would be useful to have separate macros for mode (backend) vs. specific target platform    
  - Atomic support etc.
- Documentation
  - What OCCA macro definitions exist? For the runtime API? For OKL? 
- **A discussion thread will be created on GitHub for users to submit suggestions on macros they would use**

#### Discussion
- We want to balance portability, usefulness of macros against possible combinatorial explosion of new macro definitions

- How do we expect users to handle platforms where features are not supported? Does this violate the spirit of portability?
  - Some downstream applications are already defining similar&mdash;this is an attempt to standardize macros
  - Intended for advanced users since there is no safety net
  - We should provide examples of best practices

## Action Items

- [ ] Create branch for concurrency examples (Kris)
- [ ] Organize first Tools WG meeting (Damon)
- [ ] Create examples of low/mixed-precision usage in CUDA, HIP, SYCL, etc.
- [ ] Document existing (host and kernel) macros
- [ ] Create a GitHub discussion thread for feedback on feature test macros

## Next Meeting

- [2023-11-15](2023-11-15.md)
