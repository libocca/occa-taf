## Agenda

1. Atomics

## Notes

### Atomics

- See [issue \#118](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/118) on GitHub
- Does it make sense to have a separate `@atomic` attribute, or should we have explicit device functions?
- There is no concept of scope or memory ordering with the existing `@atomic`.
  - Determinism?
- What are the restrictions on what can be placed in an `@atomic` statement or block?
  - Device memory? Host (pinned) memory? 
  - Device function calls?
  - What are the pre/post conditions 
- Where can `@atomic` statements be used in OKL code?
  - Are pointer arguments to kernel functions assumed to point to device memory?
  - Is it possible to distinguish the memory space of arguments passed to (non-kernel) device functions   
- What are the alternatives to using atomics?
- Not all hardware supports atomics
  - Need an API to query a device for support
  - Feature test macro? 
- Use cases
  - Reductions (e.g., inner-products, max, min) 

## Action Items

- [ ] Organize first Tools WG meeting (Damon)
- [ ] Create examples of low/mixed-precision usage in CUDA, HIP, SYCL, etc.
- [ ] Document existing (host and kernel) macros
- [ ] Create a GitHub discussion thread for feedback on feature test macros
- [ ] Create/find examples of atomic usage in CUDA, HIP, SYCL, etc.

## Next Meeting
