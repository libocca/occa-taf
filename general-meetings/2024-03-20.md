# 2024-03-20

## Agenda

1. Priority issues and pull requests
2. Proposal for a Kernel Language WG
3. Expanding runtime API (new features)

## Notes

### Proposal for a Kernel Language WG

- A dedicated time to discuss topics will make sure this happens
- Include new transpiler developers
- Initial meeting to map out discussions, meeting frequency
- Noel has tentatively volunteered to lead this WG

#### Potential Topics

- Constant memory?
- Collectives
- Advanced instructions (e.g., fma's, tensor inst.)

### Expanding Runtime API

- Q: Should backend-specific functionality be supported? How?
- Copy-to-symbol? (global/constant module scope variables)
  - Is this supported by most backend programming models?
- Query kernel properties
- Fill/memset (potentially outside of core scope, OCCA BLAS?)
- Aligned alloc
  - Q: What is the default alignment for each backend? 
- Rectangular (2D/3D) memory allocation, copy
  - Potentially limited use cases?
- Stream-ordered allocation
  - Convenience for programmer vs. performance improvement?
  - Potential use case: non-blocking streams
- Suggested/auto `@inner` size (e.g., occupancy-based)
  - Would potentially lose benefit from launch-bounds 
  - Maybe limited use cases--target is simple kernels where block size is less critical
- Modules/kernel-bundles
- Host-side callbacks
  - E.g., Coordinate with MPI calls? 
- Execution graphs
  - Need to gather use cases 
- Dynamic `@shared` sizes
  - E.g., to overcome limitation on size of static size shared memory 
  - Potential pitfall for performance
- Cache-configuration (L1-to-SHARED ratio)
  - Binary option
  - Causes device flush?
  - Potential for users to hurt performance if used unwisely
  - Highly likely to be backend specific
