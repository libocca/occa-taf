# General Meetings

Currently the technical advisory forum meets virtually **biweekly on Wednesdays at 16:00 UTC** to accomodate the greatest number of attendees. The frequency of meetings is likely to decrease after an initial ramp-up of activities. 

MS Teams will be used for virtual meetings. A link will be posted in the meetings notes ~15 minutes prior to the start of the meeting.
