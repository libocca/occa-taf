## Agenda

1. New transpiler walkthrough and discussion

## Notes

- https://github.com/libocca/occa-transpiler
- Current gaps
  - Variable declaration between `@kernel` and first `@outer` loop 
  - Would be good to collect as many examples as possible
- Documentation?
  - User guide
    - Build instructions
      - Using existing libclang vs. needing to build from scratch  
    - E.g., need to pass properties--existing translator is default for now  
  - Developer guide
    - How to add new attributes
    - How to implement a new backend/mode  
- Performance (e.g., vs existing transpiler)
- Potential issues: clang currently needs to use the filesystem
