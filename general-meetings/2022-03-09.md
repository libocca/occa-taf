## Notes

### Proposed First Steps

1. Implement a freeze on the addition of new features until sofware requirements and existing design have been reviewed, working groups have been established.
   - Add new features to `occa::experimental` namespace. Merge into main namespace at a future versioned release
   - Add `occa::extension` namespace so developers can extend occa capabilities to mee their own needs without the need for constant rebasing 
2. Establish working groups, leads, and initial priorities.  
3. Review how OCCA aligns with GitHub's [suggested community standards](https://github.com/libocca/occa/community).  
   - Identify areas for improvement. Delegate these to the relevant working groups. 
   - A [branch](https://github.com/libocca/occa/tree/community-profile) has been setup for collaborating on this effort.
