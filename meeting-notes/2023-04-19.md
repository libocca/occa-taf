### Release and development updates

-

### Testing supported platforms

#### OS

- Currently Linux, Windows, macOS are supported
- macOS testing is limited to GitHub CI
  - This is the only platform with support for Metal 
- Windows testing is non-existent
  - Plan to add to GitHub CI
- Need volunteers to help review/test PRs, releases on Windows and macOS
  
#### Backends

- Plans to CUDA and other toolkits&mdash;will exercise build system only due to lack of hardware
- ALCF will use internal CI to test across available hardware&mdash;NVIDIA (A100), AMD (Mi100), Intel&mdash; on Linux
- Need volunteers to help broaden coverage
- Something like CDash would facilitate amalgamation of testing results from community members


### Priority Issues

- Documentation&mdash;see pinned issues on GitHub
