## Agenda

1. Release and development updates
2. Testing supported platforms
3. Priority issues

## Notes

### Release and development updates

- [v1.5](https://github.com/libocca/occa/releases/tag/v1.5.0) was released in December
  - memory pools, interoperability API
- [Current development](https://github.com/libocca/occa/tree/development)
  - Several minor bugfixes
  - Downstream applications should test [PR675](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/675)
    - Consider testing with option to opt-out of occa headers/linking when jitting

### Testing supported platforms

#### OS

- Currently Linux, Windows, macOS are supported
- macOS testing is limited to GitHub CI
  - This is the only platform with support for Metal 
- Windows testing is non-existent
  - Plan to add to GitHub CI
- Need volunteers to help review/test PRs, releases on Windows and macOS
  - [Windows + Visual Studio](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/646)
  - [Metal backend on MacOS](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/674)

#### Backends

- Plans to CUDA and other toolkits&mdash;will exercise build system only due to lack of hardware
- ALCF will use internal CI to test across available hardware&mdash;NVIDIA (A100), AMD (Mi100), Intel&mdash; on Linux
- Need volunteers to help broaden coverage
- Something like CDash would facilitate amalgamation of testing results from community members

### Priority Issues

- Documentation&mdash;see pinned issues on GitHub
- Parsing issues
  - Support for user defined types
    - typedef struct
    - nested PODs
- Passing struct arguments by value  
- Thread safety

### Future discussions

- Backend/architecture specific kernel variants
- Device-side kernel launches

## Action Items

- [ ] Review/compare to thread safety support of backend programming models

## Next Meeting

- [2023-05-17](2023-05-17.md)
- Thread safety
  - What is current state of thread safety?
  - What aspects of library are reasonable to provide support for thread?
    - E.g., what are common use cases for multithreading 
  - Review/compare to thread safety support of backend programming models
