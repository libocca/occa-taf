## Agenda

1. Target date for next release&mdash;v1.3
2. Data type support (Noel)

## Notes

### OCCA v1.3

- Target date for next release is 2022/06/01
- This will be the start of the new bimonthly release cadence ([see notes from 2022/03/09](2022-03-09.md))
- `development` branch will be merged into `main` 
  - Final PRs will be merge by early next week (with the exception of any patches needed)
- Help is needed to test different backends/platforms/compilers
  - Windows, Mac OS X
- Use OCCA test harness, as well as downstream applications and libraries

|  Tester  | Hardware | Backends | Compilers | SDK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ALCF | A100 | CUDA, OpenCL | GNU, NVHPC | CUDA 11.6 |
|      | Mi100 | HIP, OpenCL | GNU | ROCm XX |
|      | Intel GPUs | SYCL, OpenCL | GNU, Intel (LLVM) | oneAPI XX |
|      | Intel CPUs | OpenMP, OpenCL | GNU, Intel (LLVM) | oneAPI XX |
| ...  |   |   |   |   |

### Data Types

- Currently no way to use typed device malloc for structs
- Can define custom `occa::dtype_t`, but this is clunky, error prone, and without kernel argument type checking
- Noel will lead the effort to prototype a solution&mdash;get in touch with him if you want to help with this effort
- Once protype is ready, we can revisit the dicussion.

- *Related documentation needs to be improved since many users were unaware that typed device malloc was available*
