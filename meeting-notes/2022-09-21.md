## Agenda

1. Environment Variables

## Notes

### Environment Variables

- Currently environment variables override any user defined settings (currently passed via `occa::json`)
  - E.g., compiler flags&mdash;[see issue #621](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/621)
- Opposite of expected behaviour for most libraries/frameworks
  - Environment variables are default values; user settings take precedence
  - *Todo: Check OpenMP--OMP_NUM_THREADS, vs. `set_num_threads`*
- Giving user settings precedence should not break application codes; or else, would be easy to fix

- Two behaviours: setFlags vs. addFlags

- Refactor compiler flag logic, to avoid `if-else-if` statements
  - Query environment variable
    - Use if set, else leave empty
  - Read user settings (from `occa::json`)
  - Tie-break?

- How does this effect kernel hashing?

- Use case: compiler flags which depend on runtime parameters (e.g., for optimization)

> **Corollary**   
> OCCA best practices should encourage applications to define properties&mdash;such as compiler flags&mdash;in a single configuration or header file, where they are easy to find. Inline definitions of compiler flags in application code frequently makes debugging and performance optimization more difficult.

- Documentation of all environment variables is a priority in the near-term
  - [Current documentation on environment variables](https://libocca.org/#/user-guide/command-line-interface?id=environment)

- Be sure document the change clearly in the next release notes

## Action Items

- [ ] Kris&mdash;Merge or close [PR 622](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/622)

- [ ] Examine test coverage checking that recompilation does/doesn't happen when expected
