1. Environment Variables

## Notes

### Environment Variables

- Currently environment variables override any user defined settings (currently passed via `occa::json`)
  - E.g., compiler flags&mdash;[see issue #621](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/621)
- Opposite of expected behaviour for most libraries/frameworks
  - Environment variables are default values; user settings take precedence
- Giving user settings precedence should not break application codes; or else, would be easy to fix

> **Corollary**   
> OCCA best practices should encourage applications to define properties&mdash;such as compiler flags&mdash;in a single configuration or header file, where they are easy to find. Inline definitions of compiler flags in application code frequently makes debugging and performance optimization more difficult.
