## Notes

### ECP Annual Meeting

- This is the last  year for the ECPAM
- In-person meeting is more condensed
- Tutorial and BOF sessions will be virtual, after the meeting
- Is there interest in holding OCCA related sessions?
  - BOF&mdash;will think on this some more, decide at a later date
  - Tutorial
    - Downstream application users/developers are needing to understand how to use and develop with OCCA
    - There are still many HPC codes that will need to port to new sytems post ECP
      - Fortran!

- Poster session theme "then and now"&mdash; highlighting the progress since the start of ECP
  - Good opportunity to showcase work done for the HIP and SYCL backends, Fortran!
  - Kris and Tim(?) will take the lead on submitting an OCCA poster
    - Will reach out to others about specific topics
  - Feedback/input is welcome if there is anything you want to see included
  - Add data for performance benchmark

### Memory Pools

- Noel's [memory pool implementation](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/543) is complete and ready for review
- A [new example](https://github.com/noelchalmers/occa/blob/feature/memoryPool/examples/cpp/17_memory_pool/main.cpp) demonstrates memory pool usage
- NekRS has the potential to be an early users of this feature

## Action Items

- [ ] Review and merge [PR 543](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/543)
- [ ] Review what other env variables should follow the same approach as compiler flags 

## Next Meeting

- [2022-11-16](2022-11-16.md)

### Topics

- OCCA Performance Benchmarks
  - Noel will contribute some existing benchmarks comparing OCCA vs. direct backend code
