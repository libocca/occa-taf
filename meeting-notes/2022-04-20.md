## Follow-up
*Action items from last meeting*

- [x] Document [compiler support for C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp17)
- [ ] Find volunteers to lead the efforts in various aspects of user documentation

## Agenda

1. Kernel caching
   - OpenCL, SYCL/DPC++ hashing
   - Kernel/device compatibility
   - Multiple caches (e.g. common + specific)
2. MPI aware jitting

## Notes

### Kernel Caching

#### OpenCL, SYCL/DPC++ Hashing

- Currently this is based on the device and platform id
  - See [issue 442](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/422)
  - Even for the same OpenCL implementation, there is no guarantee that the platform id will be consistent across compute nodes
- It is more sensible to check if a device is compatible with a compiled kernels, e.g.
  - Is the same device type, vendor
  - Supports the OpenCL spec used during jitting

#### Multiple Caches

- Existing functionality allows for the cache directory to be set (globally) during runtime
   - See [`setOccaCacheDir`](https://github.com/libocca/occa/blob/9923f46799461f5acf154cfd8358043ef9f449c5/src/occa/internal/utils/env.cpp#L44) 
- A new environment variable `OCCA_SYSTEM_CACHE_DIRS` will be introduced, allowing users to specify a colon-separated list of *read-only* cache directories.
- Jitted kernels will still be cached to `OCCA_CACHE_DIR`, and preference will be given to binaries located in this directory (e.g., in the event of a "tie") 

### MPI aware jitting

- Very little MPI code exists, and currently adds little value
- Ideally, MPI dependency can be removed altogether
  - Requires a mechanism for dependency injection 
- To avoid taking on technical debt while enabling users to meet individual needs, an extensible kernel builder (factory) interface will be developed
