## Agenda

1. OCCA Tools: Tracing
2. Thread safety

## Notes

### OCCA Tools: Tracing

- Demo/discussion
- Tools interface to register tracing callbacks allows for interaction with other tools/libraries
  - Follows similar approach to other portability frameworks 
- Could use Perfetto tracing as a fall-back, vendor specific tracing when available 
- For end-to-end Perfetto could use call-back functions from vendor libraries
- Third option could bake-in vendor specific tracing pragmas

### Thread Safety

- Examples of potential multithreaded OCCA usage in downstream applications?
- What is current state of thread safety?
- What aspects of library are reasonable to provide support for thread?
  - E.g., what are common use cases for multithreading 
- Review/compare to thread safety support of backend programming models
  - 
  - [SYCL](https://registry.khronos.org/SYCL/specs/sycl-2020/html/sycl-2020.html#chapter:sycl-programming-interface) guarantees that all the member functions and special member functions of SYCL classes are thread safe

- Currently no OCCA init--could be a route to opt-in to thread safety
