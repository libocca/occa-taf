### Planning for 2023

#### Development Tentative Ideas/Brainstorming

- Deprecating OpenCL mode 
  - Metal? (Test on new gen Apple HW first)
- Revisit and modernize OpenMP mode
- Potential new modes (backends)
  - Std C++ (e.g., see NVHPC)
  - ARM? 
- Matrix and vector instructions (intrinsics)
  - Could require support aligned malloc
  - Load/store  
- Downstream projects still require Makefile build
  - This build system should be reviewed to ensure all new features/modes are supported 
- CDash?
- Unified shared memory (via programming model of backends)
