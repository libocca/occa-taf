## Agenda

1. Device discovery and selection
2. Attribute to bypass parser [\#602](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/602)

## Notes

### Device Discovery and Selection

The current approach, used in examples or most applications:
```cpp
  std::stringstream device_properties;  
  std::string occa_mode;
  // Read mode from file or program options
  device_properties << "{{'mode': " << occa_mode << "}"
  
  if(("CUDA"==occa_mode) 
  || ("HIP"==occa_mode)
  || ("OpenCL"==occa_mode)
  || ("dpcpp"==occa_mode)) {
    int device_id;
    // Read device id from file or program options; determine otherwise.    
    device_properties << ",{'device_id': " << device_id << "}";

    if(("OpenCL"==occa_mode) || ("dpcpp"==occa_mode)) {
      int platform_id;
      // Read platform id from file or program options; determine otherwise
      device_properties << ",{'platform_id': platform_id}";
    }
  }
  device_properties << "}";

  occa::device occa_device;
  occa_device.setup(device_properties.str());
```

- Assumes the application (user) has implicit knowledge of available system hardware
- Requires developers to interact directly with tedious and error prone JSON format
- Requires developers to know properties available for each backend (which are not well documented)
- Default is to fallback to Serial mode

> An alternative existing approach is to use a [configuration file](https://github.com/libocca/occa/blob/development/config.default.json); implicitly, this assumes only one mode or device will be used at a time.

#### **Proposal**

1. Add enumerations for OCCA modes, device hardware types (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA)
2. Introduce a function which returns a vector of all devices, with optional device property argument for filtering.

Example
```cpp
// Get all gpu devices, regardless of mode
std::vector<occa::device> gpu_devices = occa::getDevices(occa::device::type::gpu);

occa::device occa_device;
if(gpu_devices.empty()) {
  // Developer chooses action if no GPUs are found
} else {
  int device_id = 0; //Or MPI rank, etc.
  occa_device = gpu_devices[device_id];
} 
```

This approach facilitates sorting/filtering of devices by the user (e.g., based on compute capabilities or benchmarks), as well as multi-device applications.

#### Comments

- Current JSON allows more properties to be passed that become the default for the device (e.g., for Kernels, etc.)
  - Add a member function `setProperties` to the `device` class for users who still need this effect. 

### Attribute to Bypass Parser

- Request from the nekRS team
- Intended use case is not mode-specific code, but language features which aren't yet supported in OKL

#### Comments

- Alternative: parser should only affect OKL related code--everything else should be bypassed
- An attribute will be added, potentially as a stop-gap solution in the short-term, giving time to have a long-term discussion about the future of the OKL parser

## Action Items

- [ ] Review libocca repository settings so that external collaborators can request code reviews

## Next Meeting

- [2022-09-07](2022-09-07.md)
