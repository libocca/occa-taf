Thank you to all who attended for contributing to the discussion!

## Attendees

- Stefan Frijters (VORtech)
- Noel Chalmers (AMD)
- Tim Warburton (Virginia Tech)
- Kris Rowe (ANL)

## Agenda

1. OCCA dependency requirements for kernels. (See [PR \#603](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/603))
2. Interoperability API. [See Issue \#597](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/597)

## Notes

### OCCA Dependency Requirement for Kernels

- The default will be to not include/link kernels to the full OCCA library
- Any necessary dependencies refactored into an isolated set of headers as appropriate

### Interoperability API

- The simplest approach of returning `void*` for backend types will be used
- Responsibility will be on the user to cast these to backend specific types
