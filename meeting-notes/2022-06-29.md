## Attendees

- Stefan Frijters (VORtech)
- Noel Chalmers (AMD)
- Umesh Unnikrishnan (ANL)
- Kris Rowe (ANL)

## Agenda

1. Device synchronization. ([See Issue 598](https://github.com/libocca/occa/issues/598))
2. Memory Pools. ([See PR 543](https://github.com/libocca/occa/pull/543))

## Notes

### Device synchronization

- Option 2 makes the most sense
  - Less breaking changes for existing codes
  - Less chance for new users to make performance mistakes
- Ensure both `device::finish()` and `device::finishAll()` are well documented.

### Memory Pools

- Example usage and documentation will be added 
- Features in the experimental namespace will be supported through the C++
  - C and Fortran wrapper to be added after features are integrated 
- Hesitancy about automatic defragmentation?
  - Could be better if this was an explicit action 
  - Leads to interoperability issue
- Performance counters/metrics or debug mode
