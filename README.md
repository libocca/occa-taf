# OCCA Technical Advisory Forum

## Purpose

The scope of OCCA usage and development has grown considerably since the framework's beginnings. In particular, it is a key dependency of mission-critical computational science and engineering applications in government, industry, and academia internaltionally. 

The OCCA Technical Advisory Forum aims bring together OCCA users and developers to discuss technical aspects of the framework, plan for future development, and to ensure the maintenance and reliability of the codebase.

## Structure

The technical advisory forum consists of regular general meetings, as well as a number of working groups which focus on specific aspects of the OCCA framework.

Information about specific working groups can be found via the following links:
- [architecture](working-groups/architecture/README.md)
- [devops](working-groups/devops/README.md)
- [documentation & training](working-groups/documentation-training/README.md)
- [maintenance & development](working-groups/maintenance-development/README.md)

## Meetings

Currently the technical advisory forum meets virtually **biweekly on Wednesdays at 16:00 UTC** to accomodate the greatest number of attendees. The frequency of meetings is likely to decrease after an initial ramp-up of activities. 

MS Teams will be used for virtual meetings. A link will be posted in the [meeting notes](general-meetings/README.md) ~15 minutes prior to the start of the meeting.
