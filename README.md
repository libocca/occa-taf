# OCCA Technical Advisory Forum

## Purpose

The scope of OCCA usage and development has grown considerably since the framework's beginnings. In particular, it is a key dependency of mission-critical computational science and engineering applications in government, industry, and academia internationally. 

The OCCA Technical Advisory Forum aims bring together OCCA users and developers to discuss technical aspects of the framework, plan for future development, and to ensure the maintenance and reliability of the codebase.

## Meetings

The technical advisory forum meets **biweekly on Wednesdays at 16:00 UTC** to accomodate the greatest number of attendees. To have a topic added to the meeting agenda, create a pull-request here or contact [Kris Rowe](mailto:kris.rowe@anl.gov).

Meetings are held virtually using MS Teams. **A link will be posted in the meeting notes ~15 minutes prior.**
